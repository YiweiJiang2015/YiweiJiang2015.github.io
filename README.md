I am now a Phd candidate in Ghent University, Belgium. I work in the [T2K group](https://ugentt2k.github.io/) with these cool guys. My research project has close relation with conversational agents, semantic parsing and information extraction.

### Name
姜逸伟 is my name. Due to the cultural difference, bear me for highlighting the alignment between Chinese and alphabetic systems: 姜 Jiāng 逸 Yì 伟 Wěi. 
As a custom in East-Asia, the first letter normally denotes family name (sometimes the first two characters but not in my case). 
In general, it's not difficult to pronounce it correctly in terms of its simple combination of syllables.
If you want some challenge today, try this mouthful word 阮 [Ruǎn](https://youtu.be/XVBVuFjKHYw?t=4) (no offense to anyone named with it).
Nonetheless, I found that people sometimes mistook **Jiang** as **Yang**. Emm, it is actually the same as "J" in "Joker". 
If you notice the strokes above the letters, congrats, you find new knowledge in the linguistic world. They indicate tones in Mandarin Chinese.
Further, if you are willing to learn how to master them (this [video clip](https://youtu.be/Wo13IvKqb4Y) may help), I will definitely be surprised and fully grateful with your efforts.

### Research interests
- Task-oriented dialogue systems.
- Semantic parsing: AMR representation.
- Information extraction.

### Publications
- Recipe instruction semantics corpus (RISeC): Resolving semantic structure and zero anaphora in recipes. *AACL-IJCNLP 2020* (virtual), Dec 5, Suzhou, China.

### Datasets
- [RISeC](https://github.com/YiweiJiang2015/RISeC)

### Education
- 2018- Now, Phd candidate in Computer Science Engineering, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.
- 2011-2018, BS & MS in Aerospace Power Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China.


### Misc
- Language is power. Language is your weapon.
- Besides NLP, I had some experience in plasma physics simulations owing to my master project. 
- Favorite manga: [進撃の巨人](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Titan). The final season is coming in December, 2020!
