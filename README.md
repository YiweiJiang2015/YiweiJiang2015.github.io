## About me
I am now a Phd candidate in Ghent University, Belgium. I work in the [T2K group](https://ugentt2k.github.io/) with these cool guys. <br>
My research project has close relation with conversational agents, semantic parsing and information extraction. <br>

## Name
姜逸伟 is my name. Here is the alignment between Chinese and English: 姜 Jiāng 逸 Yì 伟 Wěi. As a custom in East-Asia, the first letter is my family name. In general, it is not difficult to pronounce my name correctly if the tone is neglected. Nevertheless, I found people in Europe sometimes say **Jiang** as **Yang**. Emm, it is actually the same as "J" in "Joker". 

## Research interests
- Task-oriented dialogue systems.
- Semantic parsing: AMR representation.
- Information extraction.

## Publications
- Recipe instruction semantics corpus (RISeC): Resolving semantic structure and zero anaphora in recipes. AACL-IJCNLP 2020 (virtual), Dec 5, Suzhou, China.

## Datasets
- [RISeC](https://github.com/YiweiJiang2015/RISeC)

## Education
- 2011-2018, BS & MS in Aerospace Power Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China.
- 2018- Now, Phd candidate in Computer Science Engineering, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.

## Misc
- Besides NLP, I also have some experience in the plasma physics simulation owing to my master project. 
- Language is power. Language is your weapon.
