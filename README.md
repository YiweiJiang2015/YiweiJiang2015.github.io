[![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/google/skia.svg?style=flat)]()

I am now a Phd candidate in Ghent University, Belgium. I work in the [T2K group](https://ugentt2k.github.io/) with these cool guys. My research project has close relation with conversational agents, semantic parsing and information extraction.

### Name
姜逸伟 is my name. Given cultural differences, bear me for highlighting the alignment between Chinese and alphabetic systems: 姜 Jiāng 逸 Yì 伟 Wěi. 
As a custom in East-Asia, the first letter normally denotes a family name (sometimes the first two characters but not in my case). 
In general, it's not difficult to pronounce my name correctly in terms of its simple combination of syllables.
If you want some challenge today, try this mouthful word 阮 [Ruǎn](https://youtu.be/XVBVuFjKHYw?t=4) (no offense to anyone named with it).
Nonetheless, I found that people sometimes mistook **Jiang** as **Yang**. Emm, it's actually the same as "J" in "Joker". 
If you happen to notice the strokes above the letters, congrats, you find new knowledge in the linguistic world. They indicate tones in Mandarin Chinese.
Further, if you are willing to learn how to master them (this [video clip](https://youtu.be/Wo13IvKqb4Y) may help), I will definitely be surprised and rapturously grateful to your efforts.
